# AP-Comp-Sci-Work
Some examples of the work I did in AP Comp Sci A

## Unit 5
# 5.3.13:
Taking our Student and Classroom example from earlier, you should fill in the method getMostImprovedStudent, as well as the method getExamRange. The most improved student is the one with the largest exam score range. To compute the exam score range, you must subtract the minimum exam score from the maximum exam score.

# 5.3.7:
Here we have a program that creates an integer array. Fill in the method printOddIndices to print out just the elements stored at the odd indices of the array.

# 5.4.9:
In this problem we are going to use ArrayLists and classes to design a road trip. You have three classes: GeoLocation.java from earlier, which represents a geo location. A RoadTrip.java class which represents a road trip (or an ordered list of places), and a RoadTripTester.java class which brings them all together.
